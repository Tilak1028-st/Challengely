### 🏗️ Design Patterns
- **MVVM Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **ObservableObject**: Reactive state management
- **StateObject**: Persistent view models
- **Environment Objects**: Shared data across views

### 💾 Data Management
- **UserDefaults**: Local data persistence for user preferences
- **JSON Encoding/Decoding**: Structured data storage
- **State Management**: SwiftUI's native state management

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 or later
- macOS 14.0 or later (for development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Challengely
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   open Challengely.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Select your target device or simulator

4. Build and run the project (⌘+R)

### Testing Instructions

#### Onboarding Flow
1. Launch the app
2. Complete the 3-step onboarding:
   - Welcome screen
   - Select interests (minimum 1 required)
   - Choose difficulty level
3. Verify smooth transitions and animations

#### Challenge Experience
1. After onboarding, view the daily challenge
2. Tap "Reveal Challenge" to see the challenge details
3. Tap "Accept Challenge" to start the timer
4. Complete the challenge and observe celebration animations
5. Test the share functionality

#### Chat Assistant
1. Navigate to the "Assistant" tab
2. Try the quick suggestion buttons
3. Type custom messages and observe AI responses
4. Test the expandable input field
5. Verify character limits and validation

#### Edge Cases
- Test rapid button tapping
- Try very long messages in chat
- Test keyboard interactions
- Verify haptic feedback on all interactions

## Technical Implementation Details

### 🎨 UI/UX Excellence
- **Consistent Design Language**: Unified color scheme and typography
- **Smooth Animations**: 60fps transitions with proper easing
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type
- **Dark Mode**: Full support for light and dark themes

### 💬 Chat Implementation
- **Expandable Input**: Dynamic height calculation based on content
- **Character Limits**: Visual feedback with color-coded counters
- **Typing Indicators**: Animated dots with realistic timing
- **Message Bubbles**: Different styles for user vs AI messages
- **Auto-scroll**: Smooth scrolling to latest messages
- **Keyboard Handling**: Proper screen adjustments

### 🎯 Challenge System
- **State Management**: Proper challenge lifecycle (locked → revealed → accepted → completed)
- **Timer Implementation**: Accurate countdown with background handling
- **Confetti Animation**: Particle system with random colors and movements
- **Share Cards**: Beautiful gradient backgrounds with challenge details

### 📱 Performance Optimizations
- **LazyVStack**: Efficient message list rendering
- **Image Caching**: Optimized asset loading
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of timers and observers
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Optimized scroll performance

### 🔧 State Management Approach
- **Single Source of Truth**: DataManager as the central state store
- **Reactive Updates**: @Published properties for automatic UI updates
- **Local Persistence**: UserDefaults for data persistence
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns between models, views, and services

## Chat Design Decisions

### Input Design
- **Expandable TextField**: Grows from single line to multi-line (max 4-5 lines)
- **Character Counter**: Visual feedback with color changes (green → yellow → red)
- **Send Button**: Large, accessible button with disabled state
- **Placeholder Text**: Clear guidance for users

### Message Flow
- **Bubble Design**: Rounded corners with different colors for user vs AI
- **Timestamp Display**: Subtle time indicators
- **Typing Animation**: Bouncing dots with realistic timing
- **Auto-scroll**: Smooth scrolling to keep latest messages visible

### Response System
- **Hardcoded Responses**: Context-aware responses based on keywords
- **Response Variety**: Multiple responses for same triggers to avoid monotony
- **Realistic Delays**: 1-3 second delays to simulate AI processing
- **Context Awareness**: Different responses based on challenge type and user progress

## Edge Cases Handled

### General
- ✅ No challenges available
- ✅ Very long challenge descriptions
- ✅ Rapid tapping on buttons
- ✅ App backgrounding during active sessions

### Chat-Specific
- ✅ Very long messages exceeding character limit
- ✅ Rapid message sending (prevent spam)
- ✅ Keyboard interrupting scrolling
- ✅ Empty message submission
- ✅ Character limit reached while typing
- ✅ Multiple quick taps on send button
- ✅ Unrecognized user input (fallback responses)
- ✅ Repeated messages (response variety)

## Future Enhancements
